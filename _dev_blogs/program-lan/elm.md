    Subscriptions grabs everything that was in Mailboxes and Signals, 
    and takes it away from programmer control, 
    and instead asks the programmer "What kinds of inputs, 
    or feeds of information do you care about knowing about in your program?" 
    and "How do you want me to create messages out of these things?".
    
    So, yes, Subscriptions are a way to inject messages into your app from "effects" 
    that happen outside-your-app's context.
